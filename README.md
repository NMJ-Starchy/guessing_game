## Number game

This C++ program is a simple number guessing game to demonstrate a simple loop with if/else statements. The program randomly generates a target number using the 'random' and time.h packages so that the target number is different every time the program is run. 

There are a few simple if statements to run the game, additionally, there is a counter that adds up all of the guesses made and reports it back to the player when they reach the target as well as hints when the player is very close to the target number. The program also allows the user to choose how big of a number they can guess between.
